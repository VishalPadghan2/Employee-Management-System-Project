l've recently developed an Employee Management System using Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, and PostgreSQL!

This project helped me deepen my understanding of backend development and sharpen my skills in Spring Boot and Hibernate

Key Features:
   -> Employee registration and profile management 
   -> Role-based access and secure authentication
   -> Real-Time data management for employee records
   -> Seamless integration with PostgreSQL for efficient data handling
   -> Clean, responsive frontend using Thymeleaf for user-friendly interactions
